I know general Go concensus is to vendor all dependencies, but with increasing number of services, it becomes a hindrance. GB is great tool for this, but restoring dependencies from a private repo would require ssh keys inside my containers. I could copy/paste them to each new service. Is this a good approach? If the common lib was on a public repo, I could easily go get it from Dockerfile. Other approach I thought of is to make a Docker image with common library preinstalled on $GOPATH, and use that base image for all other containers. But that would require me to push/pull new image each time common library is updated. Is this a good approach? Finally, is there something else that is painfully obvious and can make this simpler? Ideally I would like to build services as static binaries and run them in empty containers. I am not very experienced with ""ops"" part of ""devops"". :) Thanks for the help!"

I really want to enjoy the game, and I always find it fun to watch, but I just can't seem to get into it. I mainly play Demolition or Casual, as I can't play competitive yet, and I find most of the time I am either getting stomped by experienced players, or my team is doing the stomping and I don't get to do much. So really my question is: does it get better? Will I get to play with people closer to my skill level (once it hit Private 3) so I can have a chance to enjoy the game? Thanks"

But, they won't let me add it to the recycling heap until someone's tried to sell it, which we realistically don't get around to, so it just sits there.

Hello, lovely JustNoMIL-ers! Long time luker, first time poster, yadda yadda yadda. I'm not sure whether I want to post about my own MIL yet/ever, but I witnessed a GMIL in the wild today and knew I had to share this story. This occurred at my niece's 3rd birthday party, as she was opening presents with help from her momma (my sister). She gets to the gift from me and my husband, which included lots of clothes in her current size (3T) and a few 4T winter clothes/pj's we got on clearance. Before my niece can even start pulling things out of the bag, my sister's GMIL spots the 4T hangers/tags and exclaims in an accusatory tone, ""You told me 3! That's not the size they got her!"" My sister, who is painfully non-confrontational, froze. If there had been a thought bubble over her head, it would have said ""Is this woman seriously accusing me of telling her the wrong clothing size on purpose?!?!"" I, for once in my life, bit my tongue because I do not know this woman at all. She persisted- ""But I got her threeeeeeee's!"" Finally our mom spoke up and said ""I think they just found some stuff for next winter on sale. Most of the clothes are threes."" GMIL piped down real quick- ""Oh. Ok."" Sister and I shared a quick eye-roll and giggle, but after the party my husband and I had a good laugh about how GMIlL must have been seriously inspecting each gift to notice the sizes on the clothes so quickly."

Some strategies include Aggro (go for the face as much as possible), Control (control the game) and Combo (find a few cards that correspond with each other and win with it). -**Balance your mana base.** If you want to go beyond mono-colored decks (not that being mono-colored is a bad thing), find a way to balance out your colors. Are you playing Red with a tiny bit of Blue? Get more Red sources. The new lands that tap for 2 colors should help with that. -**Play some 4-ofs.** Having more of the same card allows you to gain access to them more often. Don't play more than 60 cards, though, or you won't be able to access anything as consistently."

This may come as a shock to some of you, but if the server resets in 1.9, **I'm not re-founding Cradle**. This is to try and fix the inactivity decline. I think it's the sense of obligation to work on projects that has made me inactive. Without Cradle, that sense of obligation will not be there, or will be much smaller. Cradle will be manifested in a way on the new map, in the form of Cradle Farms. Cradle Farms will be my attempt to create a new Samin Farms. For those of you who don't know what Samin Farms is, it is a large farming complex on the south line of the nether hub. Cradle Farms will be a public farming complex with one rule: if you harvest, re-plant. However, Cradle Farms will not be founded immediately. Before the farms are founded, I will be helping out to get some more of the infrastructure of the server set up, such as a new End farm or iron farm. These projects I deem to be more important, and therefore will be worked on before Cradle Farms is founded. I hope everyone is in understanding of this decision with me. -Jpmac11 ~TheCrazyCyborg"

It was an amazing chance to work on video games, something I always wanted to do since I was a kid - and who could really pass that up? It wasn't long before I was hired on in the ranks of Customer Support, leading efforts for Atlantica Online and MapleStory for roughly a year before being swept up by the Community team - something that has now defined a huge direction in my life. I cannot believe how much I've grown as both a person and a professional by being a part of the Nexon Community. Being around co-workers who have both challenged my thinking, and pushed my skills has now defined who I am, and I am beyond grateful for their friendships. On another note, my time with you guys, the community, has really been the driving force for me to take the chances I have to push our community forward. We've had a lot of exciting changes over the last couple of years, and now, with Reboot, I hope all of you can find new friends and place where you can challenge yourself. I speak of challenge, when, really, I've been challenging myself over the past few weeks. In what is probably one of the most difficult decisions I've made recently, I've chosen to move on to a new opportunity offered to me, leaving from my position on the Community team at Nexon, and resigning from my position as the MapleStory Community Manager. This will allow me to grow and face new challenges, but none of what's next for me would be possible without the nurturing I've received at Nexon. The timing of this hits home as well, as I'll be missing out on the rest of the awesome content we have in store over the next month, and I'll also be missing out on the opportunity to run some awesome community events over the holidays with you guys, as my last day will be tomorrow, December 4th. Please don't think that my departure means you are forgotten. I am leaving the community in a place where I personally feel you are heard more than you ever have before, and our teams take all of your feedback to heart. If you ever feel discouraged, remember that, in the end of all things, we are players, just like you. As I hope you've seen over the last few months, doors are opening and people are always listening. In the interim, Sabina will be around to assist all of you with my day-to-day tasks, and the Maple Leaf Council and the Forum Volunteers will still be just as active as ever. The team here is also actively working on finding someone perfect to take over for the community full-time, and I have good faith that you guys will get an amazing Community Manager soon. I can't find the words fit enough to thank all of you for your support, friendship, kind words and, of course, harsh words over the year. Your passion shines through in each and every post that is made here and throughout our community, and I hope only that you continue to give your emotions and thoughts justice when communicating with players, staff, developers, and others. I'll never be far away from Maple World, and I'm positive that some of us will cross paths in the near future. F2 - Artasi"

For context, I was up late last night talking to my wife, who normally works graveyard work shifts but had tonight off, and she was really triggered from work and life, blah blah blah... Anyway I struggled staying awake to talk to her while she demanded back rubs as it was during my normal sleep hours. That was probably mistake #1. This morning she wakes me up early and demands me to bring her home Burger King and refuses to eat anything I've bought from the store so I have to rush to do that before work (Mistake #2). Now while I'm busy at work begins a series of texts from her and she's getting more and more pissed. I'm wondering if I should stop the TRP and de-escalate the situation or just not give a fuck. This doesn't happen very often and actually hasn't happened since I almost walked out on her months ago. Since that time I've decided to stay in the relationship without being too attached to the relationship anymore. Here are the texts: Wife: Yep. Thanks 4 being willing to come home at lunch. Me tired and me not ready 4 work. Bleech ... I don't respond since I'm busy Wife: ? Me: You're welcome Wife: U mat at me? Me: No why? Wife: You just seem distant and almost like combative. Me: No I've got three conversations going at once right now and I'm tired not really able to communicate well. Sorry Wife: Ok. My fault ur tired rite? Me: Yes but that's ok. You needed me and I'm happy you got what you wanted Wife: WHAT?! wow, just wow. I have enough drama Me: Not drama, stoicism. I say things how they are Wife: We r done. I tell there is an issue and u insist on making it worst. Great skills. U will have ppl lining up 4 u Me: I told you I was happy you got to talk to me and get breakfast. I wasn't lying when I said that Wife: We r done. Ive had ENOUGH. jack ass game over. The kids and i are washing our hands of u --- Ok I'm sure I didn't handle that conversation the best and whining about being tired doesn't do me any good.

My mind shuts down and I'll go for an ice cream sampler or pop a truffle without a second thought. Usually that acts like a gateway drug and after failing my goal of no chocolate I'll end up eating a few more. Logically I know that I should not eat these things, and even the taste is not worth it.

It was college. I had just finished playing penny poker with my friends and was headed back to my dorm. I was in pajama pants, clearly stoned, and walking home with my friend and about $2.40 in winnings. Suddenly a black car with tinted windows rolls up and two thug looking guys get out. ""Hey yo, wait up. Got a smoke for me?"" My friend pulls out a cigarette and gives it to him. He starts making small talk while his friend just stands there. Asks if we know where to get any bud. I had some in my book bag but there was no way in hell he was getting it. ""You guys wanna buy a piece?"" He said as he lifts up his shirt to a show a big ass gun in his waist band. We are both ripped and clearly not prepared for this. ""Naww, we're good,"" I said. My buddy starts nervously looking at the main street by us, which was just a couple hundred feet away. ""You run and you'll get a bullet in your back,"" the guys sneers. Then he immediately goes back to being nice. Starts asking if we have any money. Says they are from out of town and need gas money. I gave him $2.40 and my friend had a $1.25. He is pissed that's all we have. His friend is looking at him like ""you idiot, what did you expect?"" Then he tells us to get in the car. The driver is still in there, and his buddy is now flashing a gun. 3 v 2. We tell them no. They order us to get in the car. We again say no. He changes subjects, asks if we have any money in the bank. My friend doesn't have his wallet. And mine's in my bag. I tell them I only have $5 in my account. Guy asks if I can go pull it out. At this point I was scared and kind of pissed so I honestly replied ""I don't own a debit card. But if you come back tomorrow morning we can go down to 53rd, I can fill out a slip, and you can have it. It's yours"" The guy seems to mull it over for a second and decides against it. They try to get us in the car again and my friend is about to freak out. So I calmly tell them no once more. They get in their car and start to drive away. As soon as they are half way down the block we both took off running. I played sports but I ran faster than I had ever run before. I wish I could say I told them to fuck off. Or that I took a stand. But I didn't. I gave them all the money I had and tried to keep the situation cool. I am 6'4. No one had ever fucked with me before in my life. It caught me completely off guard. I survived. But it is not an experience I wish to ever go through again. Really glad they didn't ask for my book bag. I sometimes still wonder what would have happened if we had gotten in the car."

I am not whining. I'm saying that the issue of perfect gender reassignment is a lot more complicated than ""clone some tissue from donors or embryonic stem cells, do some surgery, and there you go!"" First, hormones are a major player, but so are genetics. A woman's cells will never respond to a flood of androgens and turn into male tissue: they don't have the proper receptor proteins (notably *Sry* in XY species like humans, but there are others). A XY cell does not just turn into functioning ovaries because it was denied the androgen flood. They will produce a body that does not successfully produce gametes. And cloning has its own issues: in order for it to work, you've either got to have the host's cells (which I'll grant some futuretech that could help them take the form of non-functioning sex organs) or cells that have had their antigens turned off (requiring genetic manipulation). And there's the rub, isn't it? If you want perfect transition, you need fertility. Now with Star Trek, you could have an episode that discusses the person's choice whether they want a perfect transition with fertility or an imperfect one without it. That's a personal choice, and being a personal choice with future implications, could be the source of drama. tl;dr: This isn't trolling. This is just a person pointing out the fact that no matter how complicated you think gender is, *it's more complicated than that*."

We are thinking about having another activity (maybe a writing sample in response to some general questions, or activity) that the job candidates would do between the interviews.

It is part of a samurai's bushido (his way of life, code of honor, something along those lines). A samurai does this voluntarily when he wants to die with honor, rather than at the hands of the enemy. In some cases, it's also a form of punishment for those who have brought shame upon themselves. In a way, Takeo 1.0's seppuku is both: he's trying to save the honorable samurai that he once was, by taking his own life, which has suffered for so long in a monstrous, shameful form. Another thing here is the choosing of Origins Takeo as the kaishakunin. Basically, he chose himself as his ""second"", the most trustworthy person to end his life. Once again, playing on the nature of seppuku here: Takeo would never want to die at the hands of the enemy. He has no family to turn to, and the only person that he could trust, the Emperor, sold him out to Division 9. So having another Takeo to do the job is the most fitting way to go. R.I.P.

After opening it up, you see it's a message from Arslan. It reads...* Dear Citizens o' the District of Dwarven folk and anyone who's been a Citizen in the District o' Dwarven folk, As of recently, me good buddy Jamtein recently received a bounty for 'is head by the scum of our District that is the Brotherhood o' Stone. They want 'im dead for many possible things: Attackin' people, killing someone, hell, even takin' me along with a few others arms off.

Pah, ye should've seen th' look on Fitz's face when he realized 'e lost the voting to Jamtein! Oh, wait, he doesn't really 'ave a face now, does he...?. . . Well then. Anyways, they want me buddy dead. And I'm writing this t' tell ya to not take up the bounty they're offerin', as then yer just making a huge mistake! The Brotherhood o' Stone just wants power, rule over our district. The metal clad fiends must be abolished and evicted, so we don't 'ave 't worry about the threat o' getting our heads caved in by not listening to a dwarf too cowardly to be out in the open that they need a high tech, albeit flimsy suit o' armor! Now, Dwarves, I say we together as a District, along wit' our soon-to-be new Council abolish the Brotherhood o' Stone an' kick the sorry excuses for Dwarves out o' our District! (Or, let them rot in prison, whichever floats our boat.)! *The message ends there with Arslan's Signature, but you decide to look on the other side. On the other side of the note is a message specifically to members of the Brotherhood of Stone, yet for some reason wrote it on your letter, and probably everyone else's as well. It reads...* I know what yer all plannin'. You all want Jamtein dead so you along with th' rest o' the Brotherhood can rise into power, eventually take down the Council and take over our District. You and yer other members want power, I can see it in all of your eyes every time I look at any of ye. *The message is then directed towards Hughes and Fitz.* if you want Jamtein dead so bad Hughes, yer gonna have to kill me first, and I mean that. I'm not scared of either of you.

Just curious why we saw such a huge amount of Canadian acts on the lineup last year. With the exception of neil young, fucked up, alvvays and sloan, the rest are virtually unknown artists south of the border. I get that its a canadian fest, but is this just b/c its these would be relatively cheap acts to book? I love a lot of these acts, but if you are like me and go to a lot of shows you've seen all of these acts a million times. I mean, i half expect to see Monster Truck or some other schlocky hillbilly band on the bill. For a festival hoping to draw an international audience, this doesnt really help things. For example you dont see nearly as much of this type of booking at osheaga or pemberton. These fests tend to skew more indie when it comes to canadian acts."

Many of you have likely seen premium camo on many standard tier 8 and a few tier 9 ships by now but is that camo really worth it. My opinion is, depends. If you know you're going to keep the ship then it's absolutely worth the 3100 or 4500 gold. I'm not a war gaming employee trying to get you to buy gold or pay. But if you have some extra gold lying about its a good long term deal. Let's take the Iowa. The non premium stats on the camo are -3% detection range and 4% harder to hit. The non premium camo costs 22800 credits per battle for those stats. That alone adds up to 228000 credits every 10 battles and at tier 9 that really helps offset some of the operation costs. The premium camo also provides a reduction in repair costs and a bonus to exp earned. This can shorten your grind to the Monty but also save you even more. Over 100 battles that's 50% more exp (to shorten that grind) and over 3,000,000 credits saved (that can be used for that last ship or other things). If you know you're going to hang on to a ship then there's no reason not to in my opinion. But if you just want a pure credit mill rather than buy camo for 4 ships then there's always the atago. For 1 or 2 ships it's a good way to turn them into a quasi premium at a quarter the price. I've already bought the premium camo for the mogami and fubuki and can say I love them. What are your guys opinions?"

I guess we're really supposed to write it out there and then instead of just relaying it all from memory, but whatever. The exam had no real invigilators or anything, it was in our normal classroom, with our teacher monitoring. I thought it was silly we were just memorising a script (which was already made better by our teachers, they marked it as 'homework') to relay on the paper, but what I found even more silly was how our teacher would literally go around and ""accidentally"" point at any mistakes she noticed. I would have felt pretty guilty if this happened to me (which it didn't), but even so, I think this is pretty stupid. She actually said at the start of the lesson to put up your hand if you wanted it checked, which was followed halfway through by ""I can't give anyone explicit help because I shouldn't really be doing this"". Is this common in schools or was my school cheating? Does it even matter? I'm probably overthinking this as always, but thought I'd check anyway. Thanks in advance, and good luck with your GCSEs all :)"

I hoped and prayed that i wouldn't have to. I saw starving children and scared farmers looking for help and safety from the taliban. The taliban were the one killing kids and stealing land and putting bombs in the road. But no i guess we were the bad guys because that edgy blog you read told you to think that way and having a controversial opinion gives you the attention you crave to validate your life.

Requirement was also that their servers run on separate power from the rest of the DC via a separate utility feed and separate UPS power. No gen power, despite the fact that we have plenty. AND THEN it gets fun. To open the door to their DC room, it requires someone from their department and me. So if one of my people has to get in there, I always have to be in there *and stay with them*. Server needs reboot? Three of us in there like morons because we can't remotely do anything to that network. Middle of the night outage? I always have to meet my people there. Their actual department is a separate suite, and only they have badge access to it. We can't even go in there without an escort, and when we do cellphones have to stay outside. Finally they have quarterly security audits by an outside certification agency who *always* finds something wrong, and it's *always* something insanely dumb. On the plus side, since the whole damn area is airgapped we don't go in there often as no virus outbreaks. And no helpdesk tickets because no email!

1,yeah how could your family or friends or other members of your support network possibly help you out financially if you don't live down the street from them anymore?,filonome,lostgeneration,2,2,0,2016-04,2016-04-20 21:41:18,"The problem isn't that people won't move, it's that you're asking people who are generally not well off to remove themselves from their support structures to move to unfamiliar areas with generally less diverse economies to buy cheaper housing. The trade offs are often not worth it. It's not just changing where you live, it's also getting a new job, being away from family and friends who could help if you fall on hard times etc. There's reasons people tend to stay connected to places they used to live beyond ""I'm fond of the area"" Ironically the ""Move somewhere cheap"" advice is a lot more applicable to retired people and people who are financially dependent and living on investments as they're not subject to the local economy nearly as much, are much less likely to need their support network, and aren't beholden to employment conditions. Much better to advise someone who already has a high net worth in an urban area to move somewhere cheap + retire."

1,"This seems like the dumbest thread ever.. just because you gave up on PvE means that people who have not are bad at maths and so on, makes sense ""proper csgo player"".",Bowyi,bladeandsoul,-1,-1,0,2016-04,2016-04-21 11:08:30,"Is my BnS endgame goal viable? What's yours? **My endgame**: *get my favorite chars to lvl 50, true pirate wep, full oathbreaker accessories and play arena pvp only.* I love the arena pvp system in this game. Started with destro, now going with summoner and thinking about KFM, I also have a warlock and FM. I do dailies with Summoner/Warlock, and enjoy arena with destro. This game is a massive time sink, if you want to keep up with the pve content you have to treat it like a job. Some people say it's like a part-time job, but I think if you would have a hard time maxing your char out if you treated it as a full time job. Personally, I love the game for it's character creation, storytelling, costumes, and pvp. I am sure that no one enjoys wasting time on dailies, over and over again, every single fucking day. Some famous streamers also said that they've given up on the PVE content, such as Jaesung, and I realized that it's not worth investing that much time into this game. It would arguably be better to invest real money, saving you time and letting you enjoy the game for it's pve content without grinding your brains out. The new 6v6 dungeons are rubbish, the whole concept destroys the esports aspect of the game. As a proper csgo player, following most of the popular esports, the fact that BnS was huge as an esport was what drew me in to try this game, but now it's obvious that the game will die soon, just like NCSofts other projects, such as Lineage2 did. I see people in my clan grinding for 18 hours non-stop for some idiotic silverfrost quartz, so that they can achieve their ""dream"" of gaining an edge, or at least getting closer to catching up to the most geared people in the server, which will probably not happen. I think all of that is just blatantly stupid, and you need to stop for a moment and think what you're doing to yourself. Many new people come in every day, get mesmerized by this game, and make it their goal to get to the top PVE wise. In my opinion these people are just bad at math, because if you look at all the resources you'll need to get anywhere close to the endgame (time, money, luck, effort, skill), you can easily see that you're making a very bad investment, which will never pay off. For all the people who say ""I enjoy gear progression, who are you to tell me what I like or dislike, it's like fishing, just a hobby man, it brings me joy"" ok you can continue deluding yourself, I can only address people who are good at math and not randoms who like torturing themselves in front of a monitor. /rant I know my end goals, but I've always wondered what other people want from this game. What does the average,new,old player want? What's your endgame? Favorite chars? How good are you at arena pvp?"

The solution I'd like to present is similar to the change they made to Frostqueen's Claim. Why not make Morgana's Q snare for a longer time, the longer it travels for? Make the initial snaretime 1.5 seconds, increasing it to 3 seconds every X amount of time it travels for. I think this would punish the flash Q's which do not offer any form of counterplay, and will really show who masters Morgana's skillshots and who doesn't. What do you guys think?"

Every. Single. Week. * I paid a full tithe and generous fast offering. * I was (and still am) absolutely faithful to my wife. * I did not view anything that could be considered porn, and very rarely even viewed a PG-13 movie. * My wife, family members, and friends can vouch for all of this. Finally, I was on a completely innocuous website reading a totally neutral blog entry about Mormonism when I stumbled across a comment about ""pay lay ale."" I didn't go looking for an online ""tour of the territory of the faithless."" I went looking to defend the faith from what I thought was a false accusation that ""pay lay ale"" used to be included in the temple ordinance. The joke was on me.

They will know the signs. They will know when to get help. They will be able to recognize the transition from responsible use to irresponsible. They will one day want to quit. And when they want to quit the resources should be available to them so they can get help to do it because it is no doubt difficult. Should they choose to use their should be regulations on purity and guidelines on safe responsible use, dosages, advice on driving, the same kind of info you get when you purchase drugs from the pharmacy. I believe that people can use responsibly and many will.

1,(Checks username) Easy there with the hate on ADR and Kalisto puto,LegendOfCodGod,SquaredCircle,11,11,0,2016-04,2016-04-25 06:04:05,"A reminder that six months ago today, John Cena lost clean in the middle of the ring to Alberto Del Rio on PPV in less than 8 minutes for the US title. I would say that I have no idea why that happened, but I know why: Vince gets on these little short kicks about pushing new minority stars, but he never ends up sticking with them. I was never the biggest Del Rio fan, but he was at least interesting in his first WWE. Since he's come back though, I really can't bring myself to care much about him, and I always get the feeling he doesn't care much either. I guess it's hard to care when you aren't really presented as a big deal, but he seems to have been phoning it in from the start. He also doesn't smile, I don't think I've even seen him so much as smirk since his return; he's the anti-Apollo Crews. Might seem like a minor detail, but I did enjoy his old gimmick, the Mexican aristocrat, but they've stripped away everything that made him unique and interesting. I really wish they would've reconsidered who Cena was going to drop the title to. They could've picked so many other guys, but they chose a guy that, while maybe Vince wanted to push him at the time, they didn't have any big plans for. He most notable match since winning the US title was losing a semi final match in the World title tournament. That being said, nothing against Kalisto, but with the way he's been such a non-entity on TV as of late, I really think they should consider having him drop the title. Maybe even have Cena win it back when he returns, so prestige can be brought back to it, and Cena can eventually drop it to a worthy opponent, one with a bright future."

The cops shot him multiple times in the initial volley of fire. He went down... but unlike the movies, he wasn't out of the fight. You can see he was trying to figure out how to reload, how to keep engaging. They had to pour so many more rounds into him before he finally became incapacitated, it's staggering. Of course, they kept going after he was down, but... can you really blame them? Both officers were using what any anti-gun person would consider a ""high capacity"" magazine, and it took them over 50 rounds to stop this guy, in the open, without armor, and well within engagement range for a pistol. This is why people interested in defending themselves with firearms resent the argument of ""you don't need more than [n] bullets to defend yourself"" as it relates to the regulation of what size magazine they are allowed to lawfully carry in their guns. Real gun fights are rarely how they are portrayed in the movies/TV."

Lastly, I'm absolutely elated that with Nintendo's newest Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing titles, that these 2 titles will finally rise up with Nintendo's most influential IP's like Super Mario, Legend of Zelda and Pokemon.

Questions within the ranks. Missions in trouble and the leader seems sick and senile. You can't just keep having senile leaders. I offer the church a solution that could help. It seems to me that one of the most basic organizational problems is that the people making the decisions are very old and not up to speed. Sure, they are getting briefed constantly by lawyers etc. but these backward decisions are far behind the times and trends. I say a 'revelation' is received to turn over the governing of the church to the presiding Bishopric. And let these guys be much younger. Around 50 years old. Maybe a councilor in his 40s. And here's another cool twist - bring in a WOMAN to be one of the counselors. This could be a new development in 'the lord's plan to involve sisters in the leadership of zion and the expanding understanding of priesthood in the last days.' We later find out the lord wants the sister priesthood to oversee all the children and youth of the church among other things. This younger group would make changes that are more consistent with the ever-changing cultural atmosphere of the modern world and bring the organization up to speed like a modern corporation. The 12 would still be apostles and would simply meet with stake presidents and things. The first presidency would by an honorary position and maybe change their name to First Patriarchs. They could now have the cool job of getting real spiritual and going around like the pope and just blessing people and doing sweet things with their wives. That would give them a lovely pope image. There, a quick turn around and with the new, fresh reorganization, policies are quickly dropped, changed, reworded and evolved. Suddenly, the church looks again like it might be on the move and on to something."

That's the blessing I WANTED to give. What I actually said was some benign, ""I bless you that you may recover quickly."" Then I was stumped and just ended it.

I mean, it's not rocket science, but I can see Cow Chop becoming the smartest business decision they've ever made. They've started a channel where they can grow an active and appreciative audience, unlike what we see with the Creatures nowadays. Also, from a numbers perspective, the guys get around a fourth of the views of a similar channel like Game Grumps. Obviously Game Grumps puts out more videos and has other sources of revenue, but this is pretty exciting since Cow Chop only has about a fifteenth of the subscribers. Plus, Cow Chop sometimes gets more views than their (Cow Chop's) total subscriber count. I guess my point is that Aleks and James have created a channel with high production value and a unique style, and they're having fun working on it. If they planned this for a while, we should give them credit for being talented on the business side of things. Thoughts?"

Mostly my issue is with this notion that win loss record is way too heavily weighted. That sounds odd but really it's the truth. If one team plays a meat grinder schedule and loses one game to another elite team by a few points and one team scrapes by a bunch of times through a soft schedule then it's entirely reasonable to conclude team A is better, and the system has to account for that. Like you said, the playoff simply needs to expand a little to not run into this issue. Going to eight teams would allow for undefeated teams in P5 to never be left out while still allowing for those teams that lose a game or two but are clearly deserving based on their actual ability and not just win/loss record."

I feel like his reputation exceeds him, and people who just call him nothing but a toxic player have just seen the viral moments and haven't taken the time to see what he's all about or what his stream is like. Now, I'm not saying he's not toxic, he definitely is, but it's mostly in the in-game chat. To his stream viewers, he's actually pretty nice, and that's with all the trolling going on to try to get him mad. Ultimately, I like watching his stream because you're likely to see some plays. If he sees the whole enemy team coming bot-side, he doesn't run away. He says, ""Well, I know I can kill at least one of them before I die, so let's go!"" and he makes a nice outplay to get a double kill and gets hype. It's entertaining, and that's why I watch, because there's different people I can watch when I want to learn, but if I just want to have some fun, I tune into him. And I could actually do without him flaming people in chat. But still, as strange as it is, I think I'm starting to become a Tyler1 fan."

1,Corey Schneider,IronSolace,hockey,-2,-2,0,2016-04,2016-04-29 20:35:50,"Who do you think is the most overrated player in the league? This is based on the actual definition of overrated. Some people still refer to players like Dion Phaneuf as ""overrated"", which is ridiculous, since he hasn't been held in particularly high esteem since 2008, when he was one of the best offensive defensemen in the NHL. Some consider ""overrated"" to mean ""poor"" (I don't consider Phaneuf to be a poor player, for the record). An overrated player is one who is generally revered by most or many of the league's fans, players and journalists, yet is perhaps not quite as good as their reputation would imply. In my opinion, I would say Jonathan Toews is the most overrated player in the NHL. He's an excellent defensive forward who can win a lot of faceoffs and his hardware cannot be called into question (3 cups, one Conn Smythe, one Selke trophy). That being said, to call him the best player in the league is both incorrect and, in my very humble opinion, indicative of the de-valuation of pure points. He's been point-per-game once in his whole career (2013 lockout-shortened season) and has surpassed 70 points once (2010-11). You can usually count on him to produce 65 points (not this year, though I'm willing to consider that an anomaly), but I think that, at the end of the day, the most important thing is to put the puck in the net and to set up others to put the puck in the net. I'd say that right now, Sidney Crosby, Jamie Benn, Patrick Kane, Anze Kopitar, John Tavares, Alex Ovechkin and Erik Karlsson are all better players than Jonathan Toews. There might be a few others, but these guys have been better than Toews for several years (Kopitar would probably be venerated even more by the media and fans if he was Canadian). This is not to say that Toews isn't an awesome player. I'd kill to have him playing in Vancouver and I think that without him, Chicago would not have won three cups, if any at all. He is a 30-30 guy that can win lots of faceoffs, log tons of minutes and kill penalties. I personally put more stock in a guy that can score fifty goals or produce at a point-per-game rate."

I'm very tempted to just call him Penn, because he had such a striking resemblance to Penn Jillette, even with the grating voice, that it was uncanny, but I'll try to keep with Chipmunk for this story. When I was living with Chipmunk, it was hard to not interact with him. He was loud, always loud, from piercing chirping laughter from (repetitive) viewings of Family Guy to piercing chirping laughter when a dank meme was (repetitively) on his computer screen. Often my conversations started with ""would you please watch something less hilarious when it's not late at night and I have work tomorrow"" but that didn't work, so I learned I had more success chatting with him, for up to an hour, until he got bored and disengaged from me, often heading out the door to parts unknown. I learned some interesting things about Chipmunk from these attempts to calm the laughter. One of them was that he was a soothsayer of euphoria. I decided to edit out some potential vulgarity to follow. It's written roughly the way he would say it, minus his favorite bigoted slurs. I'd rather not have some neckbeard take me out of context on the next gamergate witch-hunt. Prediction One: Mexicans and black people will take over the country entirely by 2020, and chase down white women and forcibly make half-breeds with them. This will have the effect of the nation falling to barbarism. Prediction Two: Gays and jews will watch from the sideline, pitting tribes and gangs against one another, partially for entertainment and partially for eugenics purposes (?) selecting the finest of the wild animals for super soldier programs. Prediction Three: For all their power,, the aforementioned gays and jews will be unable to fully rule world finance, because of the emergent power of bitcoin, which can objectively not be owned by any one nation or bank. They will struggle to persuade smart bitcoiners to trade in their bitcoins for increasingly-inflated-and-useless fiat, but with very little success. Because of this, trumped up arrest charges, based on child porn accusations (?), will land some unwary bitcoiners in jail with their bitcoins seized. Prediction Four: World government collapses, because of economic destabilization. Infrastructure intact, especially satellites (?), therefore bitcoin becomes the coin of the world by 2040. Prediction Five: World peace is accomplished through walled-off city-states (?) with flying cars for transit between them, Mexicans and black people roam the wastelands between the city-states, but make for real-life shooter fodder with bounties on bringing back their ears (???). He said this with the voice of a journalist, like it was sure to happen, that it was practically yesterday's news. Let that sink in. All the while, patting his desktop tower and saying ""you know, if you start mining bitcoin now, you could have your own tiny fiefdom. Not too late"""

This may seem fairly obvious, but I think there are some techniques that may help you get through a tough course. I will use Managerial Accounting for my example. When I took the pre-assessment, the passing score was 65% and the pre-assessment was 70 questions. I have a lot of practical knowledge with cost based accounting systems, so I took the pre to find out how well my existing knowledge matched the course work. Here are the results from my first attempt: Topic | Questions | How many correct | Percent correct -----|-----|-----|----- Managerial Accounting and the Business Environment | 6 | 6 | 100% Cost Management Concepts and Classifications | 7 | 4 | 57% Job Order Costing System | 5 | 3 | 60% Process Costing System | 3 | 1 | 33% Analyzing Cost Behavior for Decision Making | 5 | 4 | 80% Approaches to Cost Management | 5 | 3 | 60% Cost Volume Profit Analysis | 8 | 5 | 63% Profit Planning | 6 | 2 | 33% Flexible Budgets and Overhead Management | 6 | 1 | 17% Decision Making: Relavent Costs | 6 | 3 | 50% Capital Budgeting Decisions | 5 | 4 | 80% Evaluating Performance | 3 | 2 | 67% Responsibility Accounting | 1 | 0 | 0% Financial Statement Analysis | 4 | 1 | 25% **Totals** | **70** | **39** | **55.7%** &amp;nbsp; So, I scored a 55.7% which falls short of passing. The question I want to answer is ""What is the most efficient way to study to pass the course?"" Based on my scores above, I scored below the cut on 10 of the fourteen topics. It looks like I have a lot of studying to do to get a passing grade. I might also approach this by studying the worst topics first, thinking that this will raise my score the fastest. With this approach, I would start studying Responsibility Accounting where I scored a zero followed by Flexible Budgets where I scored a 17% and then Financial Statements at 25%. But you will notice that Responsibility Accounting is only 1 point, is my time really well spent focusing on that item first? Getting that single question right could move my score from 55.7% to 57.1% &amp;nbsp; I approach this a bit differently. I start by asking myself how many points do I really need and where is the best place to get those points. In order to get 66% correct, I will need (70 * .66) = 45.5 questions right. Round that up to 46. That means I need at least 7 more questions right to pass. Now obviously I will want more than this to be safe when I take the final, but this gives me a target to shoot for. I next look at how many questions I *missed* in each topic. This will tell me which topics will get me the most points. Here is the same table looking at misses instead of scores: Topic | Questions | How many correct | How many missed -----|-----|-----|----- Managerial Accounting and the Business Environment | 6 | 6 | 0 Cost Management Concepts and Classifications | 7 | 4 | 3 Job Order Costing System | 5 | 3 | 2 Process Costing System | 3 | 1 | 2 Analyzing Cost Behavior for Decision Making | 5 | 4 | 1 Approaches to Cost Management | 5 | 3 | 2 Cost Volume Profit Analysis | 8 | 5 | 3 Profit Planning | 6 | 2 | 4 Flexible Budgets and Overhead Management | 6 | 1 | 5 Decision Making: Relavent Costs | 6 | 3 | 3 Capital Budgeting Decisions | 5 | 4 | 1 Evaluating Performance | 3 | 2 | 1 Responsibility Accounting | 1 | 0 | 1 Financial Statement Analysis | 4 | 1 | 3 **Totals** | **70** | **39** | **31** You can see from this that Responsibility Accounting is not worth nearly as much as Flexible Budgets (5 missed) and Profit Planning (4 missed). With everything being equal, it would be possible to pass by just studying these two topics alone (a bit risky, but possible). So, my approach will be to study the following six topics, in this order: Topic | How many missed -----|----- Flexible Budgets and Overhead Management | 5 Profit Planning | 4 Cost Management Concepts and Classifications | 3 Cost Volume Profit Analysis| 3 Decision Making: Relavent Costs | 3 Financial Statement Analysis | 3 **Totals** | **21** Even if I can improve each of these by half, I will score an additional 10 points which would amount to a 70%. It may not seem like a huge difference, but for some courses it may mean the difference between three days of study and two weeks of study."

My GOD! I am conviced, after watching him he is a Terrell Owens in Calvin Johnson's body with Cris Carters' hands. He may even be a better receiver today than Dez Bryant, and Dez is a special receiver, he seems like the surest pick and a sure star in this league. Just imagine him lining up next to Dez, Witten, Williams and Beasley. We would have the strongest offense in football easily. We'd be the 2000s Rams with Holt, Bruce and that running game. I salivate like a Pavlov's dog just thinking about how explosive and dangerous the offense would be with that dominating Offensive Line and Tony Romo. The defense we can address via Free Agency and the later rounds, and a quarterback? Sure, Goff seems very intriguing and tempting, but we are in a WIN NOW mode, he couldn't even help us if Romo were to get injured as a rookie I don't think, so maybe get a Free Agent type Kitna, the best we can find, and draft Treadwell, that'd by my best wish!"

0,The root of that argument comes down to thinking their take on religion is the right one and everyone else has it wrong.,Red5point1,DebateReligion,-1,-1,0,2015-11,2015-11-24 21:45:54,"What's the point of the, ""Not all x are y,"" argument? I'm honestly so tired of hearing this. ""Not all Christians/Muslims/men/white people/etc are like that!!"" Yes, and? I feel like these statements are always made so that the feelings of the group that's being criticized could be spared and it shifts the focus of the discussion entirely. No longer are we discussing the bad sides of this or that religion (or social issue), but we're focusing on the feelings of this particular group, making our apologies, saying that, yes, when I say Muslims, I don't mean literally every Muslim that has ever lived on this planet, etc. But the problem remains. There's a group of people that's using your holy book and the values of your religion to do terrible things. They do them in the name of your God. You saying that they're not *real* xy isn't gonna change that. I feel like also focusing on how small a percentage these extremist groups make up is also missing the point. If *only* 5% of Christians or Muslims are extremist, we're still talking about huge numbers. 5% of all Christians today is more than 100 million people. So why do many discussions seem to end at, ""Well most people aren't like that and they're reading our book wrong so let me wash my hands and walk away?"" It seems to me that as soon as a group of people (any group, not just religious) needs to constantly say that they're not all like that, it's a pretty clear indication of an existing problem that merits attention and discussion."

1,Yes because teachers add nothing at all to the economy and lower the standard of living for everyone.,deleted_OP,Economics,4,4,0,2016-01,2016-01-08 05:44:55,"People need to realize every government job lowers your standard of living where manufacturing jobs raise your standard of living. You see, you must produce goods and services at a price people are willing to pay to raise the standard of living. It is wide spread access to cheap goods and services which increase your quality of life. The problem with government jobs is they don't produce anything, yet they still consume... and often in a much more wasteful manner than the private sector. Want the economy to take off? Fire 99% of public workers and throw out 99% of regulatory law and watch the free market bloom."
